# Dedicated IP

Buttondown is happy to offer dedicated IP addresses to customers who need them.

If you're on an enterprise plan and are sending at least one hundred thousand emails
per month through Buttondown, you can request a dedicated IP address for an additional
$50/month. Contact [us](mailto:support@buttondown.email) to request a dedicated IP.
