# Tags

Buttondown has two ways of segmenting subscribers who might want to receive
different content:

- Using one newsletter, but having subscribers tag themselves into different
  groups.
- Creating multiple separate newsletters.

## Using Tags

Subscribers can opt into different tags when they subscribe
(via [Buttondown URL or embedded HTML form](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base)),
but they can't remove themselves from a tag. The unsubscribe link unsubscribes
them from the newsletter entirely.

However, since these subscribers are under the same newsletter, you can easily
send the same email to a combination of tags that might be interested.

## Using Multiple Newsletters

You can [create multiple newsletters](/advanced-features/multiple-newsletters)
in Buttondown. Each newsletter has a completely separate list of subscribers,
and a completely separate archive.

When a subscriber clicks the unsubscribe link at the bottom of one newsletter,
they'll stay subscribed to your other newsletters.

However, there's no easy way to send an email to a combination of newsletters.
People who are subscribed to multiple newsletters of yours will receive
duplicate emails if you copy the same content and send it to multiple newsletters.
