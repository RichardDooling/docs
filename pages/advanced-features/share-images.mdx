# Share images (og:image)

For each of your emails in Buttondown, you can specify a “share image,” which is the image that platforms like Twitter, Facebook, iMessage, etc. will use when you share your email’s archive link.

Buttondown allows you to pick any image that you’ve used in your newsletter, or you can upload your own. In addition, we provide a few templates that you can use.

One template places more emphasis on your newsletter’s name:

![This share image design shows the newsletter’s name larger, and the subject line and date smaller.](/images/share-images/emphasize-newsletter.png)

While the other places more emphasis on your email’s subject line:

![This share image design shows the newsletter’s subject larger, and the newsletter’s name and date smaller.](/images/share-images/emphasize-subject.png)

To set a share image for an email, open the email for editing. Then, in the toolbar at the bottom, click “Web archive.” In the pop-up, you’ll see a “Share image” section, where you can select or upload your newsletter’s share image.
