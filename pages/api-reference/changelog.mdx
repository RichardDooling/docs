# Changelog

The changelog provides a list of dated updates, each of which contains a number of potentially backwards-incompatible changes. There is no explicit versioning in the API at this time; all changes will be either compatible or breaking. (If I attempt any brittle changes to the API that may break current implementations, I'll be sure to add version gates.)

## 2023-08-23

You can now filter emails by `creation_date` and `publish_date` in the [`/v1/emails`](/api-reference/emails) endpoint.

## 2023-08-21

Added [`/v1/webhooks`](/api-reference/webhooks), which allows you to create and list webhooks that will be called when certain events happen in your account.

## 2023-07-23

Added `utm_campaign`, `utm_medium`, and `utm_source` to the [`/v1/subscribers`](/api-reference/subscribers) endpoint. If these fields are not present, the values will be inferred from a provided `referer_url`.

## 2022-11-24

Added `/v1/email/:id/analytics`, which returns aggregated information about opens, clicks, and other events for a given email that you've sent.

## 2022-11-19

Removed the `/v1/drafts`, `/v1/scheduled-emails`, and `/v1/unsubscribers` endpoints. The behavior of all three endpoints have been subsumed into `/v1/emails` and `/v1/subscribers`:

- you can create (or list) drafts by specifying `status='draft'`
- you can create (or list) scheduled emails by specifying `status='scheduled'`
- you can list unsubscribers by specifying `subscriber_type='unsubscribed'`

### 2022-03-08

Added support for filtering emails in [`/v1/emails/`](/api-reference/emails) on `included_tags` and `excluded_tags`.

### 2021-11-26

Took the ability to send specific emails to subscribers out of beta; added [`/v1/subscribers/<id>/send-reminder`](/api-reference/subscribers), which allows you to send
reminders to your subscribers to confirm their email address.

### 2021-08-27

Added support for Exports via the [`/v1/exports`](/api-reference/exports) endpoint.

### 2021-01-02

Added support to set and retrieve metadata on Emails.

### 2020-12-23

Added deletion and update abilities to the Scheduled emails endpoint, giving you much more programmability than the hitherto append-only state of the world.

### 2020-12-09

Added a deletion endpoint to the Images endpoint, allowing you to delete unused images.
