# Pagination

If you've got a non-trivial number of subscribers or emails, you'll almost certainly need to paginate through them at some point.

Buttondown's API uses number-based pagination: you'll need to specify the page number you want to retrieve with the `page` query parameter. Like so:

```
  $ curl GET https://api.buttondown.email/v1/subscribers?page=2
```

(If you don't specify a page, we'll assume you want the first page.)

Additionally, responses that can be paginated always include a `next` field that contains the URL for the next page of results. If you're on the last page, the `next` field will be `null`. This looks something like the following:

```
  {
    "count": 100,
    "next": "https://api.buttondown.email/v1/subscribers?page=3",
    "previous": "https://api.buttondown.email/v1/subscribers?page=1",
    "results": [
      ...
    ]
  }
```

This means that you can easily paginate through results by following the `next` field until it's `null`. Here's an example in JavaScript:

```
const fetchSubscribers = async () => {
    let subscribers = [];
    let next = "https://api.buttondown.email/v1/subscribers";

    while (next) {
        // Note that authentication is not handled in this code snippet,
        // for clarity's sake!
        const response = await fetch(next);
        const data = await response.json();

        subscribers = subscribers.concat(data.results);
        next = data.next;
    }

    return subscribers;
};
```
