# Data Exports

Fancy yourself a meticulous bookkeeper? A methodical analyst? A punctilious archivist? (Phew, that’s a mouthful.) If so, you might find it useful to export your data from time to time, whether it’s for safekeeping or just general reference down the line. Read on to learn more about the kinds of data you can export, as well as the most convenient ways to export it. 

## Subscriber data

Head on over to the “Subscriber” tab of your Buttondown dashboard. Then on the top right, click “Export.”

After a moment or two, you’ll find a .csv file in your downloads. This .csv file will list each subscriber’s unique ID, along with their email address and any tags or metadata. 


## Survey data

If you’d like to analyze your survey data as a .csv file, venture over to “Surveys.” Select your survey of choice before clicking the “Export” button.

Once you receive your survey .csv, you’ll be able to see your survey identifier along with each subscriber’s email address and answer. 

## Email data

In the “Emails” tab, check off the email—or emails—you’d like to export. Then click the good ol’ “Export” button!

Your email .csv file will have columns for each of your emails’ unique IDs, subject lines, publication dates, and more. 

## Event data

Perhaps you’re integrating with Buttondown’s API, or using webhooks for custom workflows—either way, you might need to pay a visit to your [events](https://buttondown.email/events) log. From there, select the event you’d like to export and then click “Export” in the upper right hand corner.

When your export’s completed, you’ll receive a .csv file featuring your event ID, [type](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/events-and-webhooks), timestamp, and more.
