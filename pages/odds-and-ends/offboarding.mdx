# Offboarding

If you want to delete your Buttondown account, no hard feelings! Hit the "delete your account" button
at the bottom of your [Account page](https://buttondown.email/settings) and our data will be _instantly_
removed from our servers. (There's no recovering this, so be sure to [export your data](/odds-and-ends/data-exports) beforehand if you need your data!)

## FAQs

### I'm moving to a different website or platform. Can I point my old Buttondown page to my new URL?

Yes! [Send me an email](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I can wire that up for you.
