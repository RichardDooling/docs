# Customizing Email and Subscriber List Views

Sometimes you want things to be organized just right. We get it! That’s why we created a way for you to see all the information that you want—and nothing more—when you’re glancing at your “Email” and “Subscriber” tabs.

## Refining Your “Email” List View

Are you in the “Email” tab of your Buttondown dashboard? Good! Now all you have to do is click the “+” button in the upper right hand corner. From there, you’ll see a drop-down menu of sample “Info” and “Events” that you can use to organize your “Email” list view.

Now’s a great time to experiment with exactly what you’d like to see in your “Email” list view. Pro tip: You can use the columns to sort the emails in your list. Each of the changes you make will persist once you leave the “Email” tab as well, so there’s no need to keep resetting it.

Here’s a little overview of precisely what each column contains:

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      title: "Column",
      key: "column",
    },
    {
      title: "Description",
      key: "description",
    },
  ]}
  content={EMAIL_COLUMNS}
/>

You can pick and choose whatever combination of “Info” and “Events” you wish. The only thing you can’t remove is the email “Subject” column.

## Personalizing Your “Subscriber” List View

No two authors are exactly alike—and that extends to their “Subscriber” list views. To tailor your list view, simply toggle to the “+” button in the upper right hand corner of the “Subscriber” tab in your Buttondown dashboard. From there, you’ll have the opportunity to make a custom selection among the following “Info” and “Metadata” options.

You can also sort your subscribers based on any column of your choosing. Note that the only required column is the “Email” column.

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      title: "Column",
      key: "column",
    },
    {
      title: "Description",
      key: "description",
    },
  ]}
  content={SUBSCRIBER_COLUMNS}
/>

Not seeing some of these columns listed? That’s because you might not have certain data available. For instance, if you don’t use [metadata](https://docs.buttondown.email/advanced-features/metadata), the “Metadata” column won’t be listed as an option—because, well, there’d be nothing to populate it with! However, if you ever do want to start using metadata to [sort your subscriber base](https://docs.buttondown.email/advanced-features/metadata), then the option will pop up.

## Going Above and Beyond

You’re ready to go off and organize to your heart’s content. Just one last thing: If you ever think up a column that’s not listed here, we’d love to hear about it! You can always email us at support@buttondown.email.
