# Scheduling Emails via the API

We've already covered how to create, list, and update emails using the [Buttondown API](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/emails#EmailType). Here, we’ll take things a step further by learning how to programmatically schedule emails. This may come in handy if:

-   You like to plan ahead.
    
-   You want to send your email at a time when your subscribers are most likely to read and engage with it.
    
-   The content of your email is timed to a specific holiday, event, or other notable date.

The best part? We only have to add two new lines of code.

## Schedule your email

As promised, it only takes two extra lines of code to specify your email’s “Status” and “Publish Date.”

<MultiLanguageSnippet
    snippets={{
        python:`
import requests
import json
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Token #{API_KEY}"
}
base_url = "https://api.buttondown.email"
endpoint = "/v1/emails"
data = {
    "subject": "Scheduled for the future",
    "body": "Welcome to my time-traveling email!",
    "status": "scheduled",
    "publish_date": "2027-08-24T14:15:22Z"
}
response = requests.post(
    base_url + endpoint,
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps(data)
).json()
print(response)`, ruby: `
require "HTTParty"
require "json"
response = HTTParty.post("https://api.buttondown.email/v1/emails",
    body: {
        subject: "Scheduled for the future",
        body: "Welcome to my time-traveling email!",
        status: "scheduled",
        publish_date: "2027-08-24T14:15:22Z"
    }.to_json,
    headers: {
        "Authorization" => "Token #{API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type" => "application/json"
        }
    )
    puts JSON.parse(response.body)`, curl: `
curl -X POST "https://api.buttondown.email/v1/emails" \
-H "Authorization: Token {API_KEY}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "subject": "Scheduled for the future",
    "body": "Welcome to my time-traveling email!",
    "status": "scheduled",
    "publish_date": "2027-08-24T14:15:22Z"
}'`
}}
/>

### Parameters

Scheduled emails follow a similar set of [parameters](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/emails) as [non-scheduled emails](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/emails)—that is, except for the “Publish Date” and “Status.” In this case, “Publish Date” should be a date and time in the future, and “[Status](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/emails#EmailStatus)” should be “Scheduled.”

### Results

So you’ve submitted your request to the Buttondown API. How do you know if it worked? There are three ways to check:

- Visit the [API reference](https://buttondown.email/requests) tab in your Buttondown dashboard.
- Compare your response to the ones listed in our “[Emails](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/emails)” API reference doc.
- Take a look at the “[Emails](https://buttondown.email/emails)” tab of your Buttondown dashboard. If your request was successful, you’ll see your email subject, along with a status of “Scheduled”!

## Reschedule your email

Change your mind about your email's pub date? No worries—it’s a quick fix. All you need is an "Email ID" and a few more lines of code.

  
How do you find your "Email ID" you may ask? There are two ways: 
- Pinpoint your "Email ID" in the response of your last successful request for that particular email. 
- Mosey over to the “[Emails](https://buttondown.email/emails)” tab of your Buttondown dashboard, and click on the email in question. From there, you can copy the "Email ID" from the email’s URL.

![Sample "Email ID" in URL](/images/emails/scheduling-emails-api-reference-email-id.png)

Once you have your "Email ID" at the ready, you can use the following code to update your "Publish Date."

<MultiLanguageSnippet
    snippets={{
        python: `
import json
import requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Token #{API_KEY}",
}
data = {
    "publish_date": "#{NEW_PUBLISH_DATE}",
}
base_url = "https://api.buttondown.email"
endpoint = "/v1/emails/#{EMAIL_ID}"
response = requests.patch(
    base_url + endpoint,
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps(data)
)
print(response)`, ruby: `
require "HTTParty"
require "json"
response = HTTParty.patch("https://api.buttondown.email/v1/emails/#{EMAIL_ID}",
    body: {
        publish_date: "#{NEW_PUBLISH_DATE}"
    }.to_json,
    headers: {
        "Authorization" => "Token #{API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type" => "application/json"
    }
)
puts JSON.parse(response.body)`, curl: `
curl -X PATCH "https://api.buttondown.email/v1/emails/{EMAIL_ID}" \
-H "Authorization: Token {API_KEY}" \
-d '{"publish_date": "{NEW_PUBLISH_DATE}"}'`
}}
/>

## Unschedule your email

Stuff happens. If you decide that you’d rather save your scheduled email as a draft for later, you can do so by changing your email’s "[Status](https://docs.buttondown.email/api-reference/emails#EmailStatus)."

<MultiLanguageSnippet
    snippets={{
        python: `
import json
import requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Token #{API_KEY}",
}
data = {
    "status": "draft",
}
base_url = "https://api.buttondown.email"
endpoint = "/v1/emails/#{EMAIL_ID}"
response = requests.patch(
    base_url + endpoint,
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps(data)
)
print(response)`,
        ruby: `
require "HTTParty"
require "json"
response = HTTParty.patch("https://api.buttondown.email/v1/emails/#{EMAIL_ID}", 
    body: {
        status: "draft"
    }.to_json,
    headers: {
    "Authorization" => "Token #{API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type" => "application/json"
    }
)
puts JSON.parse(response.body)`, curl: `
curl -X PATCH "https://api.buttondown.email/v1/emails/{EMAIL_ID}" \
-H "Authorization: Token {API_KEY}" \
-d '{"status": "draft"'`
}}
/>
