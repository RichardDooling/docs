# Funding Open-Source Software

Software sits on the shoulders of giants.

Buttondown is a tool that simply would not exist without the gargantuan effort of many, _many_ open-source projects, the vast majority of which are drastically underfunded relative to the value they provide.

I've committed to donating at least 10% of Buttondown's profits to the software that enables it. This is a relatively low number in absolute terms — I'm certainly not changing anyone's life — but I think it's still important.

(The final tally: since the start of this initiative, I've donated $15,982 to projects relevant to Buttondown's success. That's not that much, and yet it is much more than many companies ten times as large as Buttondown.)
