Sender information can be set in [Settings â†’ Basics](https://buttondown.com/settings/basics). Here's what this looks like:

![Screenshot of author information in Buttondown settings](/images/author-settings.jpg)

By default the:
- "Username" will be the "From address".
- "Author name" will be the "From" name displayed in the email client.  
- "Email address" will be the default "reply-to" address.

For example, using the settings in the screenshot above, a newsletter header would look like this:

```
from:	Paul L'Astname <jenna@buttondown.email>
reply-to:	paul@buttondown.email
mailing list:	jenna@buttondown.email
```
If [Tracked replies](/replies#tracked-replies) are enabled, the reply-to address will instead be in the following format: `replies+BIG-LONG-ID-NUMBER@buttondown.email`

```
from:	Paul L'Astname <jenna@buttondown.email>
reply-to:	replies+1234-5678-9101-1121@buttondown.email
mailing list:	jenna@buttondown.email
```

## Choosing an Author name
While there's no real "best" practice for setting a Author name, we recommend setting it to something you readers recognize and expect. That could be your name, or the name of your business or organization.

To frame this differently: Your Author name is an opportunity to drive engagement with your newsletter. The best way to do this is by preventing reader confusion.
