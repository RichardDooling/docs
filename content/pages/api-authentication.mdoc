title: Authentication
---
Clients should authenticate by passing the token key in the `Authorization` HTTP header, prepended with the string `Token `(note the trailing space!).

For example, if your token was `401f7ac837da42b97f613d789819ff93537bee6a`, your headers may look like this.

```python
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Token 401f7ac837da42b97f613d789819ff93537bee6a'
}
```

You can find your API key at the top of your [API requests page](https://buttondown.email/requests).
