Stripe offers a [test mode](https://stripe.com/docs/test-mode) that allows you to test your integration without actually charging a credit card. This is great for testing your integration, but it's not something that Buttondown supports.

Unfortunately, your best bet is to use a real credit card and then refund the charge. This is a bit of a pain (and you'll lose a couple pennies each time you do so), but it's the best way to test your integration.
