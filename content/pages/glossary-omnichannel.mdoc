title: Omnichannel
---

Omnichannel is a marketing/ecommerce term for using multiple channels to reach a customer: for instance, reaching out to customers not just via email but also via SMS, digital ads, push notifications, and so on.

(Buttondown does not do omnichannel: it's a tool for sending _only_ email.)
