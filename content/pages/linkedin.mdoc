## Overview

Buttondown lets you connect your LinkedIn account to your newsletter. This uses our [automations](/automations-introduction) feature to automatically share your newsletters to your LinkedIn profile.

## Set up the LinkedIn integration

Here's how to connect your LinkedIn account to Buttondown:

1. In Buttondown, navigate to **Settings** and click [Integrations](https://buttondown.com/settings/integrations).
1. Find the "LinkedIn" integration option and click **Connect**. LinkedIn opens.
1. Authorize Buttondown to post to your profile.

After you connect your LinkedIn account, a "Connected to LinkedIn" message displays on the Integrations page.

## Share your newsletters to LinkedIn

To share your newsletters to LinkedIn, you can create an automation that posts your newsletters to LinkedIn whenever you send them. To do this, create a new [Automation](https://buttondown.com/automations/new), or just click the Automation banner below:

{% automation
   name="Automatically post to LinkedIn"
   description="This automation will automatically post new emails onto LinkedIn"
   trigger="When an email is sent"
   url="https://buttondown.com/automations/new?trigger=email.sent&action=create_linkedin_post&name=Automatically+post+to+linkedin"
   action="Post on LinkedIn" /%}

The simplest and most common use case is to create an automation that posts your newsletters to LinkedIn whenever you send them. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the [**Automations**](https://buttondown.com/automations) page and click **New**. The "New automation" panel opens.
1. (Optional) Give your automation a human-readable "Name."
1. Set the **Trigger** to  [when an email is sent](/api-webhooks-event-types#email.sent).
1. Set the **Action** to [Create a LinkedIn post](/automation-actions#create_linkedin_post).
1. (Optional) Configure any other fields to customize the automation. If you leave these fields blank, the automation will post to your LinkedIn account as soon as you send a new newsletter email.
1. Click **Save changes**.

To enable the new automation, either click **Unpause** in the automation panel, or click to enable the automation's toggle in the [**Automations**](https://buttondown.com/automations) page.

## Frequently asked questions

### Does Buttondown integrate with "Linkedin Newsletters"?

[LinkedIn Newsletters](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a522525) is a feature that LinkedIn launched in 2024. It allows you to create newsletters that are syndicated to your followers.

Buttondown does not support LinkedIn Newsletters. This is for a simple reason: LinkedIn does not expose APIs or hooks for LinkedIn Newsletters, just for standard posts.

It's also worth noting (somewhat pedantically) that LinkedIn Newsletters are not actually newsletters. They're syndicated posts to a group of followers on LinkedIn, but unlike _actual_ email newsletters you cannot access your subscribers' email addresses, send them emails, or export them to another platform. It's more analogous to a Facebook group than an email newsletter.
