If you want to delete your Buttondown account, no hard feelings! Hit the "delete your account" button
at the bottom of the [Danger Zone page](https://buttondown.com/settings/danger-zone) and our data will be _instantly_
removed from our servers. (There's no recovering this, so be sure to [export your data](/data-exports) beforehand if you need your data!)
