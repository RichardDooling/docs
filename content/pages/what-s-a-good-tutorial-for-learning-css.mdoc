While you don't *need* to know HTML & CSS to use Buttondown, if you really want to get creative with the look and feel of your newsletter it helps to be familiar with the *lingua franca* of the internet itself.

Our favorite tutorial on the subject is the [free tutorial offered by Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css): it's approachable, easy, and will arm you with knowledge for a wide variety of platforms (not just Buttondown!)
