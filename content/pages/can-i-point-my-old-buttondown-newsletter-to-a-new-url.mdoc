Sometimes our users find a newsletter platform that better meets their needs. No hard feelings! But if you're moving off of Buttondown to a different website or platform, you want to make sure old links to your Buttondown account don't suddenly break.

We don't have a do-it-yourself feature to enable link forwarding, but if you [send us an email](mailto:support@buttondown.email), we can set this up for you.
