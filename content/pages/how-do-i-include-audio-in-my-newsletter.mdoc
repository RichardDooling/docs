Buttondown doesn't support native audio uploading like we do with images. 

We do have integrations with [Soundcloud](https://buttondown.email/features/integrations/soundcloud) and [YouTube](https://buttondown.email/features/integrations/youtube). Your best bet at the moment is to upload your audio to one of those platforms and then plop it into your newsletter. (Though we do have an [active backlog item to improve audio embedding](https://github.com/buttondown/roadmap/issues/840)!)
