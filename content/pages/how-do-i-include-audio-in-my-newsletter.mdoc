Buttondown doesn't support native audio uploading like we do with images, nor do we have active plans on supporting it.

However, we do have integrations with many _other_ platforms, including:

- [Soundcloud](https://buttondown.com/features/integrations/soundcloud),
- [YouTube](https://buttondown.com/features/integrations/youtube)
- [Transistor](https://buttondown.com/features/integrations/transistor)
- [Spotify](https://buttondown.com/features/integrations/spotify)
- [Vimeo](https://buttondown.com/features/integrations/vimeo)

Your best bet at the moment is to upload your audio to one of those platforms and then plop it into your newsletter.
