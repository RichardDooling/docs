---

A webhook is a generic term used for an abstraction that lets you send data from one application to another, generally concomitant with some sort of event (like a new email being sent or a premium subscription getting canceled). In the context of Buttondown, a webhook is a way to send data from Buttondown to another application or codebase.

The sky’s the limit when it comes to using webhooks to automate Buttondown workflows. Whether you’re looking to sync your subscribers or contents with Notion, grow your subscriber base through Linktree, or create a community for your subscribers on Slack, webhooks are an incredibly useful way to connect Buttondown with your other favorite apps or your own codebase.
