Webhooks are useful tools that can automate workflows between two or more apps. When a webhook is triggered by a specific event in one app, it will automatically complete an action in another app.

The sky’s the limit when it comes to using webhooks to automate Buttondown workflows. Whether you’re looking to sync your subscribers or contents with Notion, grow your subscriber base through Linktree, or create a community for your subscribers on Slack, webhooks are an incredibly useful way to connect Buttondown with your other favorite apps.

So, how do you create a webhook? Buttondown integrates seamlessly with Zapier, a paid platform that guides users through the process of generating webhooks. Check out our Linktree guide for an in-depth example of how to get started.
