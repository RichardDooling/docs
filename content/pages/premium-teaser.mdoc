If you have a paid newsletter, you might still want to send a "teaser" version of the email to your free subscribers, to encourage them to upgrade to the paid subscription.

1. Write your full paid email.
1. Add an empty line at the point in your email where you'd like to hide the rest. Type `/paywall` and select the Paywall option (making sure your editor is set to Fancy Mode).
1. Now, everything below the Paywall block will only be visible to [Premium](/api-subscribers-type#premium) subscribers, and [Regular](/api-subscribers-type#regular) subscribers will see only what's above the Paywall along with a link to pay for a subscription.
1. Send the email to a [Public](/api-emails-type#public) audience. This way, the email will be sent to both paid and unpaid subscribersâ€”but the different types of subscribers will see different content.
