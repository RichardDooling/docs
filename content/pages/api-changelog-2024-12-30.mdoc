**Breaking change**: we've unshipped the `is_comments_disabled` field from emails, and replaced it with a more flexible `commenting_mode` field.

The `commenting_mode` field is now a string that can be one of the following values:

- `"enabled"`: comments are enabled
- `"disabled"`: comments are disabled
- `"enabled_for_paid_subscribers"`: comments are enabled, but only for paid enabled_for_paid_subscribers.
