We've added `subscriber_import` as a filter to [the `GET /v1/subscribers` endpoint](/api-subscribers-list), which allows you to filter subscribers by the import in which you brought them in.

(It's not easy to actually _get_ that ID from the API at the moment, we know. More stuff coming soon in that area!)
