title: Updating a subscriber
endpoint: /subscribers/{id_or_email}
method: patch
---

You'll notice that the endpoint is `/subscribers/{id_or_email}`, not `{id}`. This is because you can retrieve a subscriber by either their ID or their email address, so you don't have to store or remember the ID if you don't want to.

If you update a subscriber's type from `premium` to `unsubscribed`, it will also cancel their backing Stripe subscription.
