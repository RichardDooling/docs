navigationTitle: Can I self-host Buttondown?
---

Buttondown is a hosted service, and we don't currently offer a self-hosted version of the software. We're a small team and we're focused on making the hosted version of Buttondown as good as it can be, and the administrivia required to support a self-hosted version is not something we're interested in taking on at this time.
