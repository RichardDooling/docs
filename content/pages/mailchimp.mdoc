## FAQs

### Do subscribers need to re-enter their credit card?

Mailchimp and Buttondown use the same payments processor â€” [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ "Stripe").

Stripe has your subscribers' information:

- credit cards
- purchases
- subscriptions

You bring your subscribers' history to Buttondown when you connect your Stripe account to Buttondown. You will have their payment histories, too.

**Your paying subscribers do not need to do anything extra when you switch to Buttondown**. Just email me when you've connected your Stripe account. I'll take care of the rest, for free!

P.S. Over time, I'd like to make this process a little more automatic but at the moment it requires a bit of manual labor on my part to make sure everything is wired up correctly (free of charge, of course.)

### I see a bunch of different subscriber lists in my export! Which one should I choose?

If you're seeing three CSVs, with names like:

- `cleaned_members_export.csv`
- `unsubscribed_members_export.csv`
- `subscribed_members_export.csv`

You should choose `subscribed_members_export.csv`. This is the list of all of your _active_ subscribers.

While "cleaned" and "unsubscribed" members are still in your Mailchimp account, they are not active subscribers. They are either unsubscribed or have been cleaned from your list, and so you don't want to bring them over to Buttondown.
