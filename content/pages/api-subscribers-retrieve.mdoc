title: Retrieving a subscriber
endpoint: /subscribers/{id_or_email}
method: get
---

You'll notice that the endpoint is `/subscribers/{id_or_email}`, not `{id}`. This is because you can retrieve a subscriber by either their ID or their email address, so you don't have to store or remember the ID if you don't want to.
