Also known as a "welcome sequence" or "automation", a drip sequence is a series of emails automatically sent to a new subscriber over a period of time. For example, you might send a welcome email to a new subscriber, followed by a series of emails that introduce them to your content (one after a day, one after a week, etc.).
