title: Buying a custom domain
---

This topic explains what a custom domain is and how to think about buying and configuring one.

## Understanding custom domains

A custom domain is a unique URL that's attached to a website's IP address. It's a memorable shorthand that helps customers find a website by typing the domain name into their browser's address bar instead of memorizing a long IP address. For example, if you wanted to associate a memorable phrase with your personal website, you could register "yourname.com" as a custom domain.

## Why would you want a custom domain?

There are two reasons to use a custom domain for your newsletter:

1. To _send_ newsletter emails from your custom domain. This means that the email Buttondown sends comes from your domain rather than Buttondown's. This improves your email's deliverability and means your subscribers will look for your email, even if eventually you end up using a newsletter service other than Buttondown.
2. To _host_ archives on your custom domain. This is useful for building a distinct brand and presence for your newsletter on the web instead of using "buttondown.email/yourusername".

## How much does a custom domain cost?

The answer, as always, is "it depends". Domains generally cost around $10â€”$20 annually; rare or in-demand domains can cost much, much more than that.

## Choosing a domain name

We recommend finding a domain name that is _as close to_ your name or your newsletter's name as possible. This will make it easier for people to remember and find your newsletter.

When you choose a custom domain for your website or online project, there are a few additional things to consider:

1. Choose a domain name that is short and easy to remember. Avoid using hyphens or numbers, as these can be confusing and harder to remember.
2. Check to see if the domain name you want is available. You can do this by using a domain name registrar or checking the WHOIS database.
3. Consider purchasing multiple variations of the domain name, such as the .com, .net, and .org versions, to protect your brand and prevent others from using similar names.
4. Be aware of any potential trademark issues. Make sure you are not using a domain name that infringes on someone else's trademark or intellectual property rights.
5. Think about the long-term. Choose a domain name that you will be happy with for the foreseeable future, as it can be costly and time-consuming to switch to a new domain name later on.

## Registering your domain

Once you've got a domain name in mind, it's time to actually purchase it! There are a number of different services, which are called "domain registrars," that allow you to do this.

We recommend using [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). It's cheap, easy to use, and has a good reputation.

Both services will prompt you for a domain name. If your top choice is available, it will let you purchase your domain (at what is hopefully a reasonable price!) and you're all set. If not, they will suggest variations on that domain that may be available (perhaps with a different 'TLD', like .net instead of .com, or with some hyphens or additional words included.)
