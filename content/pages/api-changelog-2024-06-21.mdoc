We've added two new top-level routes for you to query from:

- [`/survey_responses`](/api-surveys-list-responses)
- [`/events`](/api-emails-events)

These endpoints were previously sequestered under the `/surveys` and `/emails` routes, respectively. Now, you can query them directly without
needing to implicitly filter on a given survey or email, making it easier to batch large bits of data across multiple sources.
