title: Paywall
---

A paywall is a method of restricting access to content via a paid subscription, such that free subscribers can only see a small subset (or "teaser", if you really want to get jargon-heavy) of the content. This is a common method of monetizing content on the web, and is used by many newspapers and magazines.

Buttondown, of course, supports using a paywall as part of our [paid subscriptions](/paid-subscriptions) functionality.
