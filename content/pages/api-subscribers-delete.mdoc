Note that deleting a subscriber with an active Stripe subscription will _not_ cancel any backing Stripe subscriptions tied to that subscriber. If you're interested in programmatically cancelling a subscriber's Stripe subscription, be sure to [update the subscriber's type](/api-subscribers-update) to `unsubscribed` beforehand.
