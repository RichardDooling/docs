title: "WYSIWYG"

WYSIWYG stands for "What You See Is What You Get". It is a type of editor that allows you to see the final result of your content as you are editing it. This is in contrast to plain text editors, where you only see the raw text and have to use special syntax to format it.

Buttondown's editor allows you to _choose_ between a WYSIWYG editor and a plain text editor. You can toggle between the two by clicking the "Options" button in the top right corner of the editor.
