Alpine.js is a JavaScript framework that lets you compose behaviors, like forms, directly in the markup of a file. 

You can use Alpine.js forms to collect your subscribers' email addresses or other information. Because Buttondown has a traditional `<form>` endpoint, you can take advantage of the built-in Alpine.js support for `action` and `method` attributes and get up and running in seconds.

Here's a code example:

{% liveCodeBlock
   filename="public/code/alpinejs/basic.html" /%}

And that's it!

## Next steps

After you have subscribers flowing through your website (and your newsletter), you can start [sending emails to them](/sending-your-first-email). Or, if you're interested in classifying and enriching your subscribers to get a better understanding of who they are and how they subscribed to your newsletter, you can set up [tags](/tags) and [metadata](/metadata) fields.
