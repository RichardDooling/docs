By default, newly created subscribers are subject to [double opt-in](/glossary-double-optin) â€” they will receive an email asking them to confirm their subscription,
and have a state of [`unactivated`](/api-subscribers-type#unactivated) until they do so.

You can't disable this behavior globally, but you _can_ disable it on a per-subscriber basis by providing a `subscriber_type` of `regular` in the request body.
