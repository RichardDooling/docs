Stripe is a great product, but it's not available for all payment methods or countries.

1. If you're interested in purchasing a subscription **as a subscriber to a paid newsletter which uses Buttondown**, you must use Stripe or negotiate with the author themselves; Buttondown does not support alternate payment gateways.
1. If you're interested in purchasing a subscription **as an author who wishes to use Buttondown**, you may also use PayPal. If you're interested in using PayPal, we only allow annual subscriptions. You can email [support@buttondown.email](mailto:support@buttondown.email) to get it set up!
